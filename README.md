# CA-CAE: Channel Attention-enhanced Convolutional Autoencoder for Multi-Omics Cancer Subtype Classification and Prognosis Prediction

**CA-CAE** is a deep learning-based framework designed for pan-cancer patient stratification and survival prediction using multi-omics data. By integrating mRNA-seq, miRNA-seq, and DNA methylation datasets, CA-CAE captures complex biological interactions across omics layers and identifies survival-associated cancer subtypes with high precision. The model introduces a channel attention mechanism into a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) structure, enabling adaptive weighting of critical biological features to enhance interpretability and performance.
